Image Processing API
This repository contains an image processing API built using Node.js and MySQL.

Installation
Clone the repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/almightymoon/image-processing-api.git

Navigate into the root directory of the project:
cd image-processing-api

Run Docker Compose to set up the environment:
docker-compose up
This will create the necessary Docker containers.

Usage
Once the Docker containers are up and running, you can inspect the MySQL database container to view the values in the database.

Access the API through the following URL:

http://localhost:3000
You should see a welcome message indicating that the server is running.

To test the API endpoints, you can use Postman or any other API testing tool.

Make a POST API call to the following endpoint:

http://localhost:3000/api/image/process
In the request body, select the "raw" option and enter your JSON data.

To run the application locally without Docker, make sure to update the values in the environment file (env) to use host=localhost.
